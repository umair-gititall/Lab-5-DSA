**University Lab Project – Understanding Queues & Expression Evaluation**  
*Author: Umair 🌟*

---

## 📚 Lab Overview

This lab focuses on implementing and exploring the functionality of **Linear Queues**, **Circular Queues**, and **expression manipulation** using data structures like **Stacks** and **Queues** in C++. 🌀

### 🎯 Objectives

- Understand FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principles through Queues.
- Implement `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` operations.
- Simulate real-world problems using **Linear** and **Circular Queues**.
- Practice **Infix ➜ Prefix conversion** and **Expression Evaluation**.

## 🛠️ Tasks Implemented

### ✅ Task 1 – Quiz Competition (Linear Queue)
Simulates a quiz competition using two queues:
- First queue stores students waiting for their turn.
- Second queue stores students' scores and time taken after attempting the quiz.
- Menu-driven program with these options:
  1. Add student
  2. Start quiz
  3. Display results
  4. Exit

### ✅ Task 2 – Coffee Shop Queue (Circular Queue)
Simulates a coffee shop queue system using a **Circular Queue**:
- Manages customer names with menu options:
  1. Add customer
  2. Remove customer
  3. Show queue size
  4. View first customer
  5. View last customer
  6. Exit

### ✅ Task 3 – Infix to Prefix Conversion
C++ code that takes an infix expression and converts it into its prefix form using stack operations.

### ✅ Task 4 – Expression Evaluation
Evaluates a given infix expression by first converting it to postfix or prefix, then calculating its result.
